# DIPE209
Repository for E209 DIP Project - Applying Deep Learning on Skin Lesion Detection (Scene Understanding)

This project is inspired from https://github.com/yuanqing811/ISIC2018 of participating in ISIC2018 Challenge Task 1 and Task 3.

Task1:

InceptionV3 Training time: 963s/epoch - 15s/step

DenseNet169 Training time: 1053s/epoch - 17s/step

VGG16 Training time: 1191s/epoch - 19s/step

VGG19 Training time: 1367s/epoch - 22s/step

ResNet50 Training time: 652s/epoch - 10s/step

Task3:

InceptionV3 Training time: 95s/epoch, 188ms/step
